## Recent Work History

### Security Fixes (2025-08-01)
**CRITICAL**: Resolved PostgreSQL URI exposure detected by GitGuardian
- **Issue**: Hardcoded database credentials exposed in 4 files
- **Exposed passwords**: 
  - `qYsSoNHsFiSRLdVzmzHknIBufxqQwmmK` (shuttle.proxy.rlwy.net:57798)
  - `WxSSoUGRLEMHfpxpBfQZoiAvvBdRrDls` (tramway.proxy.rlwy.net:31100)
- **Resolution**: 
  - Removed hardcoded URIs from all files
  - Replaced with `process.env.DATABASE_URL`
  - Created `.env.example` template
  - Updated `.gitignore` to prevent future leaks
  - **STILL REQUIRED**: Rotate database credentials in Railway

### Product Name Change (2025-08-01)
- **Changed**: "Tamarind_Splice" → "Tamarind_Sweets"
- **Files updated**: 6 files across frontend and backend
- **Database**: Created update script but not yet executed

## Current Architecture

### Database
- **Production**: PostgreSQL on Railway
- **Local Development**: SQLite fallback
- **Key Tables**: users, products, sub_products, orders, subscriptions, coupons

### Key Products
- **Tamarind_Sweets** (formerly Tamarind_Splice) - ID: `fixed-tamarind-stew-id`
- **Quantum_Mango** - ID: `fixed-quantum-mango-id`

### Authentication & Security
- JWT tokens with HttpOnly cookies
- Rate limiting with express-rate-limit
- Helmet for security headers
- PayPal integration for payments and subscriptions

## Important File Locations
- **Main server**: `server.js`
- **Database setup**: `postgresql-setup.js`
- **Frontend**: `public/` directory
- **Admin endpoints**: Secured with key `rells-kitchen-admin-2025`

## Development Notes
- **Environment Variables**: Use `.env.example` as template
- **Testing**: Admin endpoints available at `/admin/*` with proper key
- **Git**: Main branch, commits include Claude attribution

## Current Issues

### Products Not Displaying (2025-08-01)
- **Issue**: Website shows "2 Signature Items" but no products display in menu
- **Root Cause**: Frontend/Backend mismatch during product name change attempt
- **Status**: Under investigation
- **API Status**: `/api/products` returns correct data (Tamarind_Splice, Quantum_Mango)
- **Frontend**: Reverted to look for "Tamarind_Splice" to match database
- **Next Steps**: Investigate JavaScript console logs and deployment issues

**NEXT STEPS** (if session disconnected):
1. **Email Notifications**: Implement nodemailer for admin alerts
   - Install: `npm install nodemailer`
   - Add SMTP configuration (Gmail/SendGrid)
   - Create email templates for new orders and low stock
   - Integrate with order completion and inventory checks
2. **SMS Notifications**: Implement Twilio for critical alerts
   - Install: `npm install twilio`
   - Add Twilio credentials to environment variables
   - Create SMS templates for urgent notifications
   - Add SMS triggers for out-of-stock and order failures
3. **Real-time Notifications**: Add auto-trigger on order completion
   - Hook into PayPal capture success
   - Check inventory levels after each order
   - Send notifications based on admin preferences
